# Artist Statement
For this project, I knew I wanted to curate and randomize cars. With the vast variety of cars and car modifications, I thought that I'd have no trouble finding data. However, I had no idea how I was going to turn that data into something visually cohesive. In a kind of backwards and strange workflow, I decided to just start drawing a bunch of cars first and let the ideas come to me.
