# Artist Statement
For this project, I knew I wanted to curate and randomize cars. I'm a big fan of modified cars so I wanted to do something related to them. With the vast variety of cars and car modifications, I thought that I'd have no trouble finding and collecting the data. However, I had no idea how I was going to turn that data into something visually cohesive. In a kind of backwards and strange workflow, I decided to just start drawing a bunch of cars first and let the ideas come to me. After drawing a few and getting a theme going, it started to remind me of those Adobe Flash games. Which gave me the idea to randomize a sort of fake game menu screen. Obviously randomizing cars wasn't enough, so I also drew a bunch of wheels and backgrounds to randomize along with the cars. Just for a little extra interest, I also decided to randomize the name on the menu screen as I just couldn't come up with one single name I was happy with. The result was a fake menu screen with a randomized background, a randomized car, a randomized set of wheels, and a random name.
